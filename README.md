Implement a simple deep neural network for solving the polynomial y = 5x^3 - 8x^2 - 7x + 1 with the following specifications:

. Use three hidden-layers of sizes 32, 64, and 128 and display the generated DNN with the required number of parameters.
. Generate training samples within the range of -20 to +20. Use the appropriate method for normalizing the training data in the range of -1 to +1.
. Use 5% of the samples as test data and 5% of the samples as validation data and the rest of the data for training the DNN with and appropriate number of epochs.
. Display the training accuracy vs validation accuracy and training error vs validation error curves.
. After training, use the test data for prediction and display the prediction accuracy vs true levels of the test data.
